# Pyhton Programming for beginners

As part of this project, i am collating all the code examples that i am doing as part of my Python learning. Intention is that it can be of use to others who also wants to get along with Python.

This project is mostly focused on code examples and very leass of theory.

After spending quite some time online to identify a good resource, i found https://thepythonguru.com/. Material is very well structured here & starts with very basics so it is easy for beginners to understand the subject. 

## Getting Started

I would recommend you to refer https://thepythonguru.com/ as mostly my code is inspired and organized per this site(as it is my learning source).
Before you  start referring to the code examples here, it is highly recommended that you understand the beasics - for that please complete the topics till 'Control Statements' from the mentioned site.

### Prerequisites

This project uses the Jupyer notebooks. I would recommend you to install Anaconda, please visit https://jupyter.org/install & follow the instructions.

### Using the notebook

Once installed, open Jupyter notebooks(from Anaconda or by searching Jupyter in start menu on windows). Checkout this code & open 'Learning_Python.ipynb' file in Jupyter Notebook.



Happy Learning !!!!
